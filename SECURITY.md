# UnoUI Security Policy

We take the security of UnoUI and its users seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow the process below so we can address it promptly and responsibly.

## Support Status

- Current status: pre-release/unversioned
- We fix vulnerabilities on the latest main branch
- No guaranteed backports to historical commits

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not create a public GitHub issue or discuss vulnerabilities publicly.

Preferred reporting channel (private):
- Use GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting (Security Advisories) feature:
  - Go to the repository's Security tab → "Report a vulnerability" and submit a private report to the maintainers.

If you cannot access GitHub’s Security Advisories, you may alternatively:
- Provide a minimal, non-sensitive heads-up via a new issue titled "SECURITY: request for private contact" so a maintainer can reach out privately.

### What to include
To help us triage quickly, please include:
- A clear description of the issue and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (PoC if available)
- Affected commit/branch and environment details
- Any suggested mitigations or fixes
- Whether you’d like public credit upon disclosure

### Our commitment and timeline
- We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours.
- We will provide a status update at least every 7 days until resolved.
- Once a fix is ready, we’ll coordinate a disclosure timeline with you.

## Disclosure Policy
- We aim to release a fix before any public disclosure.
- After a fix is published, we may publish a security advisory summarizing impact, affected commits/branches, and upgrades/workarounds.
- We will credit reporters who wish to be acknowledged.

## Scope
This policy covers security issues in this repository’s UnoUI packages and code. Vulnerabilities originating in third‑party dependencies should be responsibly disclosed to their respective maintainers; we may also coordinate if appropriate.

## Safe Harbor
We support good‑faith security research. As long as you:
- Make a good‑faith effort to avoid privacy violations, service degradation, or data destruction
- Do not exploit a vulnerability beyond the extent necessary to prove its existence
- Report the issue promptly through the channels above and give us reasonable time to remediate

we will not pursue legal action related to your research on this project.
